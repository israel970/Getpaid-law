            <h2>Why You Need a Round Rock Wrongful Death Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">When you lose a family member due to someone else's negligence, no amount of money can truly compensate for your loss. But a wrongful death lawsuit can provide financial security for your family, hold responsible parties accountable, and give you a sense of justice. Our Round Rock wrongful death attorneys handle these sensitive cases with compassion while aggressively pursuing every dollar your family deserves.</p>
            <p>Texas wrongful death law allows surviving spouses, children, and parents to pursue claims against those whose negligence caused their loved one's death. Separately, a survival action can recover what the deceased person could have recovered had they lived. Understanding these complex claims requires experienced legal guidance.</p>
            <p>In Round Rock, wrongful deaths result from car accidents, truck accidents, workplace incidents, medical malpractice, defective products, and other causes. Each type of case has unique challenges, and our attorneys have experience across all wrongful death categories.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Who Can Sue:</strong> Texas allows surviving spouse, children, and parents to bring wrongful death claims. Claims must be filed within three months, or a court-appointed representative can file.</li>
                <li><strong>Survival Action:</strong> Separate from wrongful death, survival actions recover what the deceased could have recovered—medical expenses, pain and suffering before death, and other pre-death damages.</li>
                <li><strong>Damages Available:</strong> Wrongful death damages include lost financial support, lost companionship, mental anguish, and loss of inheritance. No caps apply to most wrongful death damages.</li>
                <li><strong>Statute of Limitations:</strong> Texas wrongful death claims must be filed within two years of the death. Medical malpractice death cases have additional requirements.</li>

            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Who can file a wrongful death lawsuit in Texas?</h3>
                    <p>The surviving spouse, children, and parents of the deceased can file wrongful death claims in Texas. If no family members file within three months, the estate's representative can file on behalf of all beneficiaries.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What compensation is available in wrongful death cases?</h3>
                    <p>Wrongful death damages include loss of financial support, loss of companionship and consortium, mental anguish of survivors, loss of inheritance, and funeral expenses. Survival actions add the deceased's pain and suffering and medical expenses before death.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long do I have to file a wrongful death lawsuit?</h3>
                    <p>Texas has a two-year statute of limitations for wrongful death claims, running from the date of death. However, gathering evidence and building a strong case takes time, so consulting an attorney promptly is important.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I file a wrongful death claim if there's a criminal case?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Criminal and civil cases are separate. You don't need a criminal conviction to pursue civil wrongful death claims, and you can receive civil compensation regardless of criminal case outcomes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What causes wrongful deaths in Round Rock?</h3>
                    <p>In Round Rock, wrongful deaths commonly result from traffic accidents on roads like Interstate 35, State Highway 45 Toll, US Highway 79 and FM 1431 (University Boulevard), workplace accidents, medical errors, and violent crimes. Each type of case requires different investigation and legal strategies.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How are wrongful death cases valued?</h3>
                    <p>Courts consider the deceased's age, health, earning capacity, and relationship to survivors. The value of lost financial support, household services, guidance, and companionship are calculated. Expert economists often testify about future losses.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long do wrongful death cases take?</h3>
                    <p>Wrongful death cases typically take 18-36 months due to their complexity, emotional nature, and high stakes. Cases requiring extensive investigation or expert testimony take longer. We work to resolve cases as efficiently as possible while ensuring maximum recovery.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I pay attorney fees upfront for a wrongful death case?</h3>
                    <p>No. We handle wrongful death cases on contingency, meaning we advance all costs and only get paid if we recover compensation. Our fee is a percentage of the recovery, allowing families to pursue justice without financial burden.</p>
