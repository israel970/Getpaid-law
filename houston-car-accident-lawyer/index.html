Our attorneys evaluate your specific circumstances to estimate fair compensation."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Should I accept the insurance company's first offer?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Almost never.

            <h2>Why You Need a Houston Car Accident Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Car accidents are the leading cause of personal injury claims in Texas, and Houston is no exception. With 67,234 motor vehicle crashes reported in Harris County last year alone, the chances of being involved in a collision are unfortunately high. When you're injured due to another driver's negligence, you need an experienced Houston car accident lawyer who understands local roads, local courts, and how to maximize your compensation.</p>
            <p>Texas follows a modified comparative fault system, meaning you can recover damages as long as you're less than 51% at fault for the accident. However, insurance companies routinely try to shift blame to victims to minimize payouts. Our attorneys know their tactics and fight back aggressively to protect your rights.</p>
            <p>In Houston, car accidents most frequently occur on Interstate 45 (Gulf Freeway), Interstate 10 (Katy Freeway), US Highway 59/I-69 (Southwest Freeway) and Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Tollway). These high-traffic corridors see everything from minor fender-benders to catastrophic multi-vehicle collisions. Regardless of where your accident occurred, our team has the experience to investigate your case, identify all liable parties, and pursue every dollar you deserve.</p>

            <h2>Why Choose a Local Houston Attorney?</h2>
            <p>A local Houston car accident attorney offers significant advantages over out-of-town lawyers. We know which intersections are dangerous, which roads have poor lighting or design flaws, and which insurance adjusters are most likely to lowball claims. We've appeared before judges in Harris County courts hundreds of times and understand how local juries evaluate car accident cases.</p>
            <p>Our office is conveniently located to serve Houston residents. We can meet you at home, at the hospital, or wherever is most convenient during your recovery. Time is critical in car accident cases—evidence disappears, witnesses forget details, and the statute of limitations in Texas is just two years from the date of the accident.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comparative Fault:</strong> Texas uses modified comparative fault, allowing recovery if you're less than 51% at fault. Your compensation is reduced by your percentage of fault.</li>
                <li><strong>Statute of Limitations:</strong> You have two years from the accident date to file a lawsuit. Missing this deadline bars you from recovering compensation.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum Insurance:</strong> Texas requires 30/60/25 liability coverage ($30,000 per person, $60,000 per accident, $25,000 property damage). Many drivers carry only minimums.</li>
                <li><strong>Damage Caps:</strong> Texas doesn't cap economic or non-economic damages in most car accident cases, but punitive damages are capped.</li>

            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much is my Houston car accident case worth?</h3>
                    <p>Car accident settlement values depend on injury severity, medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering, and insurance coverage. Minor injuries may settle for $10,000-$25,000, while serious injuries involving surgery or permanent damage often exceed $100,000. Our attorneys evaluate your specific circumstances to estimate fair compensation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I accept the insurance company's first offer?</h3>
                    <p>Almost never. Initial settlement offers are typically far below fair value. Insurance companies make low offers hoping injured victims will accept before understanding the full extent of their injuries and damages. An experienced attorney can often negotiate significantly higher settlements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if the other driver doesn't have insurance?</h3>
                    <p>You may still recover compensation through your own uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage. Texas law requires insurers to offer this coverage. Additionally, we investigate whether other parties may be liable, such as employers of commercial drivers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long do car accident settlements take in Houston?</h3>
                    <p>Simple cases with clear liability may settle in 3-6 months. More complex cases or those requiring litigation typically take 12-24 months. We work efficiently to resolve your case while ensuring you receive fair compensation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where should I seek medical treatment after a car accident in Houston?</h3>
                    <p>For emergencies, go to the nearest trauma center such as Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center. For non-emergencies, urgent care centers can document injuries. Follow up with specialists as needed. We can recommend trusted medical providers who work with accident victims.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What are the most dangerous roads for car accidents in Houston?</h3>
                    <p>In Houston, car accident accidents frequently occur on Interstate 45 (Gulf Freeway) (particularly near I-45 at I-610 interchange), Interstate 10 (Katy Freeway) (particularly near I-10 at I-610), US Highway 59/I-69 (Southwest Freeway) (particularly near US-59 at I-610). These roads see heavy traffic and multiple factors contribute to their high accident rates.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need a lawyer for a minor car accident?</h3>
                    <p>Even 'minor' accidents can involve hidden injuries like soft tissue damage that manifests days or weeks later. If you have any injury, consulting an attorney is wise. Our consultations are free, and we only get paid if you win.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What evidence should I collect after a car accident?</h3>
                    <p>Photograph the scene, vehicle damage, and injuries. Get contact information from witnesses. Request a copy of the police report. Save all medical records and bills. Don't give recorded statements to the other driver's insurance without consulting an attorney first.</p>
