            <h2>Why You Need a Round Rock 18-Wheeler Accident Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">18-wheelers are the largest vehicles on Round Rock roads, and when they crash, the results are often devastating. These massive trucks can weigh 80,000 pounds fully loaded—20 to 30 times heavier than a typical passenger car. The physics of such collisions create forces that passenger vehicles simply cannot withstand, resulting in catastrophic injuries and fatalities.</p>
            <p>If you've been injured in an 18-wheeler accident in Round Rock, you're facing powerful adversaries. Trucking companies have teams of lawyers, adjusters, and accident reconstruction experts whose job is to minimize what they pay victims. Our firm levels the playing field with aggressive investigation, deep knowledge of federal trucking regulations, and a track record of winning against large trucking companies.</p>
            <p>In Round Rock, 18-wheeler accidents frequently occur on Interstate 35, State Highway 45 Toll, US Highway 79 and FM 1431 (University Boulevard). These highways carry heavy commercial traffic, and driver fatigue, aggressive schedules, and inadequate maintenance contribute to crashes. We investigate every aspect of these accidents to identify all liable parties and maximize your recovery.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Federal Weight Limits:</strong> 18-wheelers are limited to 80,000 pounds gross weight and specific axle weight limits. Overweight trucks have longer stopping distances and are more prone to brake failure.</li>
                <li><strong>CDL Requirements:</strong> 18-wheeler drivers must hold a Commercial Driver's License with specific endorsements. Employers must verify qualifications and cannot hire drivers with disqualifying violations.</li>
                <li><strong>Drug and Alcohol Testing:</strong> Federal law requires pre-employment, random, post-accident, and reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol testing for commercial drivers.</li>
                <li><strong>Electronic Logging Devices:</strong> Federal law requires 18-wheelers to use ELDs that automatically record driving time, preventing falsification of paper logs.</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Round Rock 18-Wheeler Accidents</h2>
            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What makes 18-wheeler accidents so dangerous?</h3>
                    <p>The massive weight differential—80,000 pounds versus 4,000 pounds for a typical car—creates devastating forces. 18-wheelers also have much longer stopping distances, larger blind spots, and higher centers of gravity making rollovers more common.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much compensation can I get for an 18-wheeler accident?</h3>
                    <p>18-wheeler accident settlements are among the largest personal injury awards due to severe injuries and high insurance minimums ($750,000 for most interstate trucks). Settlements ranging from hundreds of thousands to several million dollars are common for serious injuries.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Who can I sue after an 18-wheeler accident in Round Rock?</h3>
                    <p>Potentially liable parties include the driver, trucking company, cargo loading company, maintenance provider, truck or trailer manufacturer, and sometimes the shipper. We investigate thoroughly to identify all parties with responsibility and insurance coverage.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What should I do immediately after an 18-wheeler accident?</h3>
                    <p>Call 911, seek medical attention, document the scene if possible, get the truck's DOT number and company name, and contact an attorney before speaking with any insurance company. Don't sign anything or give recorded statements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where do 18-wheeler accidents occur most often in Round Rock?</h3>
                    <p>In Round Rock, 18-wheeler accident accidents frequently occur on Interstate 35 (particularly near I-35 at SH-45 Toll), State Highway 45 Toll (particularly near SH-45 at I-35), US Highway 79 (particularly near US-79 at I-35). These roads see heavy traffic and multiple factors contribute to their high accident rates.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Which hospitals treat 18-wheeler accident injuries in Round Rock?</h3>
                    <p>Due to the severity of 18-wheeler crash injuries, victims typically need trauma center care. Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Round Rock provides Level I or Level II trauma services for the serious injuries these accidents cause, including traumatic brain injuries and spinal cord damage.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does an 18-wheeler accident lawsuit take?</h3>
                    <p>These complex cases typically take 12-24 months when litigation is required. Some cases settle faster with strong evidence and cooperative defendants. We work to resolve cases efficiently while ensuring full compensation for our clients.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is hours-of-service and why does it matter?</h3>
                    <p>Hours-of-service rules limit how long truckers can drive without rest (11 hours driving in a 14-hour window after 10 hours off). Violations cause driver fatigue, a leading cause of 18-wheeler accidents. ELD data can prove these violations.</p>
