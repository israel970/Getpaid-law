            <h2>Why You Need a West Texas Slip and Fall Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Slip and fall accidents can cause serious injuries—broken bones, traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, and more. When property owners fail to maintain safe conditions, they can be held liable for the injuries that result. Our West Texas slip and fall attorneys understand Texas premises liability law and know how to prove property owner negligence.</p>
            <p>Many people dismiss slip and falls as minor accidents or feel embarrassed about falling. Don't let these feelings prevent you from getting the compensation you deserve. Property owners have a legal duty to maintain safe premises, and when they breach that duty, they should be held accountable.</p>
            <p>In West Texas, slip and fall accidents occur at grocery stores, restaurants, retail shops, office buildings, hotels, apartment complexes, and many other locations. Common hazards include wet floors, uneven surfaces, poor lighting, broken stairs, and missing handrails. Our attorneys investigate each case to identify what hazard caused your fall and who failed to address it.</p>

            <h2>Texas Slip and Fall Laws</h2>
            <p>Understanding Texas law is crucial for maximizing your recovery. Here are key legal principles affecting slip and fall cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Premises Liability Duty:</strong> Property owners owe invitees (customers, guests) a duty to maintain reasonably safe premises and warn of known hazards.</li>
                <li><strong>Notice Requirement:</strong> To recover, you generally must prove the owner knew or should have known about the hazard. Evidence includes how long the hazard existed and inspection practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Open and Obvious Defense:</strong> Property owners may claim hazards were 'open and obvious.' However, this defense has limits, and owners can't ignore dangerous conditions just because they're visible.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparative Fault:</strong> If you're partially at fault for not watching where you were going, your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault.</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About West Texas Slip and Falls</h2>
            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What should I do after a slip and fall accident?</h3>
                    <p>Report the incident to management and ensure they document it. Take photos of the hazard and your injuries. Get contact information from witnesses. Seek medical attention. Don't sign anything or give recorded statements to insurance without consulting an attorney.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I prove a slip and fall case?</h3>
                    <p>You must prove a hazardous condition existed, the property owner knew or should have known about it, they failed to address it, and the hazard caused your injuries. Evidence includes incident reports, photos, witness statements, surveillance footage, and maintenance records.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What compensation can I receive for a slip and fall?</h3>
                    <p>You can recover medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and sometimes punitive damages if the owner showed gross negligence. Serious falls involving broken bones or head injuries often result in significant settlements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does it matter where I fell?</h3>
                    <p>The type of property affects what duty the owner owed you. Business visitors (invitees) receive the highest protection. Social guests (licensees) receive less. Trespassers generally can't recover except in limited circumstances.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where do slip and fall accidents commonly occur in West Texas?</h3>
                    <p>Slip and fall accidents in West Texas commonly occur at grocery stores, big-box retailers, restaurants, hotels, apartment complexes, parking garages, and commercial buildings throughout the area.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where should I go for medical treatment after a fall?</h3>
                    <p>For serious injuries, seek emergency care immediately. Medical Center Hospital provides treatment for fall injuries including broken bones and head injuries. Even for seemingly minor falls, get evaluated—some injuries don't appear immediately.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long do I have to file a slip and fall lawsuit?</h3>
                    <p>Texas has a two-year statute of limitations. However, evidence can disappear quickly—surveillance footage is often overwritten within days or weeks. Contact an attorney immediately to preserve evidence.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I was partially at fault for my fall?</h3>
                    <p>Texas uses modified comparative fault. You can recover if you're less than 51% at fault, with damages reduced by your fault percentage. Insurance companies often exaggerate victim fault, so having an attorney advocate for you is important.</p>
