            <p class="lead">Vehicles in the workplace - forklifts, trucks, loaders, and other industrial equipment - cause thousands of serious injuries and deaths each year. Workers are struck, run over, crushed, and pinned by these heavy machines.</p>
            <p>Employers must maintain safe traffic patterns, train operators properly, and ensure vehicles are in good working condition. When they fail, injured workers deserve full compensation.</p>
