            <p class="lead">Malicious prosecution occurs when criminal charges are brought against you without probable cause and for improper purposes. Victims endure months or years of legal proceedings for crimes they did not commit.</p>
            <p>When prosecutors or police knowingly pursue baseless charges, or hide evidence of innocence, they can be held civilly liable. These cases require proving the prosecution was initiated without probable cause and with malicious intent.</p>
