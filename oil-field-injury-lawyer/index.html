            <h2>Why You Need a Oil Field Injury Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">The oil and gas industry is one of the most dangerous in America. Workers face risks from explosions, toxic chemicals, heavy equipment, and extreme conditions. When companies cut corners on safety to increase production, workers pay the price.</p>
            <p>Oil field injuries often involve multiple responsible parties: drilling companies, equipment manufacturers, staffing agencies, and service contractors. Our attorneys know how to identify all liable parties and maximize your recovery.</p>
