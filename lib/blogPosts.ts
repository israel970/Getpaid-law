The moments after a car accident are chaotic and stressful. Your heart is racing, adrenaline is pumping, and you may be hurt. But the actions you take in these critical moments can make or break your ability to recover compensation later.

This guide walks you through exactly what to do after a car accident in Texas—step by step.

## Step 1: Stop and Stay at the Scene

Texas law requires you to stop immediately after any accident involving injury, death, or property damage. Leaving the scene (hit and run) is a criminal offense that can result in jail time, even if the accident wasn't your fault.

**What to do:**
- Pull over to a safe location if possible
- Turn on your hazard lights
- Stay at the scene until police arrive and clear you to leave

## Step 2: Check for Injuries and Call 911

Your health comes first. Check yourself and passengers for injuries, then call 911 immediately.

**Important:** Even if you feel fine, some injuries don't show symptoms right away. Soft tissue injuries, concussions, and internal bleeding can take hours or days to manifest.

**What to tell 911:**
- Your location (use your phone's GPS if needed)
- Number of vehicles involved
- Any visible injuries
- If anyone is trapped or unconscious

## Step 3: Move to Safety (If Possible)

If your vehicle is blocking traffic and can still move, Texas law requires you to move it to the shoulder or a nearby parking lot. However, only do this if:
- No one is seriously injured
- It's safe to move
- Your vehicle is drivable

If you can't move your vehicle, stay inside with your seatbelt on until help arrives (unless there's a fire or other immediate danger).

## Step 4: Document Everything

Your phone is your most valuable tool at an accident scene. Use it to document:

**Photos to take:**
- All vehicles involved (from multiple angles)
- License plates
- Damage to each vehicle
- Skid marks or debris on the road
- Traffic signs and signals
- Weather and road conditions
- Your visible injuries

**Information to collect:**
- Other driver's name, phone, and address
- Their insurance company and policy number
- Their driver's license number
- Make, model, and color of their vehicle

## Step 5: Talk to Witnesses

Witnesses can be invaluable to your case. Their unbiased account of what happened can counter any lies the other driver tells later.

**What to ask witnesses:**
- What they saw
- Their name and phone number
- If they'd be willing to give a statement

Don't pressure anyone, but a simple "Did you see what happened? Can I get your number in case my insurance needs to talk to you?" usually works.

## Step 6: Talk to Police—But Be Careful

When police arrive, be cooperative but careful with your words.

**Do:**
- Give the officer your license, registration, and insurance
- Describe what happened factually ("I was driving south on I-35 when the other car changed lanes into me")
- Tell the officer about any injuries
- Ask for the police report number

**Don't:**
- Admit fault or apologize
- Speculate about what happened
- Argue with the other driver
- Exaggerate your injuries

Anything you say can be used against you later. Stick to facts.

## Step 7: Seek Medical Attention

Go to the hospital or urgent care immediately, even if you feel fine. This is critical for two reasons:

1. **Your health:** Some injuries are hidden. A doctor can identify problems before they become serious.

2. **Your case:** Insurance companies will argue that if you didn't see a doctor right away, you must not have been hurt that badly. Don't give them this ammunition.

**Follow all medical advice.** Go to every appointment. Take prescribed medications. If a doctor recommends physical therapy, do it. Gaps in treatment hurt your case.

## Step 8: Report to Your Insurance

Texas requires you to report accidents to your insurance company promptly. When you call:

**Do:**
- Give basic facts about the accident
- Mention you were injured and are seeking treatment
- Ask about your coverage (medical payments, UM/UIM)

**Don't:**
- Give a recorded statement
- Accept a quick settlement
- Sign anything without legal advice

Remember: Your insurance company is not your friend. They want to pay you as little as possible.

## Step 9: Don't Talk to the Other Driver's Insurance

The other driver's insurance company will call you—probably within 24 hours. They'll sound friendly and concerned. Don't be fooled.

Their goal is to get you to say something that hurts your case or accept a lowball settlement before you know what your claim is worth.

**What to say:** "I've been in an accident and I'm still treating for my injuries. I'm not ready to discuss the claim yet."

Then hang up and call a lawyer.

## Step 10: Contact a Car Accident Lawyer

Here's the truth: Insurance companies have teams of adjusters, investigators, and lawyers whose job is to pay you as little as possible. You need someone on your side who knows how to fight back.

A good car accident lawyer will:
- Handle all communication with insurance companies
- Investigate the accident and gather evidence
- Calculate the true value of your claim
- Negotiate for maximum compensation
- Take your case to trial if necessary

**And here's the best part:** Most car accident lawyers work on contingency, meaning you pay nothing unless they win your case.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Posting on social media:** Insurance companies will search your Facebook and Instagram for posts that contradict your injury claims. That photo of you smiling at a party? They'll use it to argue you're not really hurt.

**Waiting too long to get legal help:** Evidence disappears. Witnesses forget. The statute of limitations in Texas is just 2 years. The sooner you talk to a lawyer, the stronger your case.

**Settling too quickly:** Insurance companies love to offer quick settlements because they know the amount is far less than your claim is worth. Never accept an offer without talking to an attorney first.

If you've been injured in Texas, time is not on your side. The clock starts ticking the moment you're hurt, and if you wait too long to take legal action, you could lose your right to compensation forever.

This guide explains the Texas statute of limitations for personal injury claims—and why you should act sooner rather than later.

## The Basic Rule: 2 Years

In Texas, you generally have **2 years from the date of your injury** to file a personal injury lawsuit. This is called the statute of limitations.

Miss this deadline by even one day, and the court will almost certainly dismiss your case. No exceptions, no extensions, no second chances.

**This 2-year deadline applies to:**
- Car accidents
- Truck accidents
- Motorcycle accidents
- Slip and fall accidents
- Workplace injuries (for non-subscribers)
- Product liability cases
- Most other personal injury claims

## Special Rules and Exceptions

While the 2-year rule applies to most cases, some situations have different deadlines:

### Claims Against the Government (6 Months!)

If your injury was caused by a government entity—a city bus, a state employee, a federal vehicle—you have much less time.

**Texas Tort Claims Act:** You must file a formal notice of claim within **6 months** of your injury. Miss this deadline and you cannot sue the government entity.

### Medical Malpractice (2 Years, but...)

Medical malpractice claims have a 2-year statute of limitations, but with a twist. If you didn't discover your injury right away (for example, a surgeon left an instrument inside you), the clock might start when you discovered or should have discovered the injury.

However, Texas has a "statute of repose" that bars most medical malpractice claims after **10 years**, regardless of when you discovered the injury.

### Minors (The Clock Pauses)

If the injured person is under 18, the statute of limitations is "tolled" (paused) until they turn 18. This means a child injured at age 10 would have until age 20 to file a lawsuit.

**But don't wait.** Evidence disappears. Witnesses move away. It's always better to act quickly.

### Wrongful Death (2 Years from Death)

If a loved one dies due to someone else's negligence, the 2-year clock starts on the date of death—not the date of the accident that caused the death.

## Why You Shouldn't Wait

Even though you technically have 2 years, waiting is a mistake. Here's why:

### Evidence Disappears

Surveillance footage gets deleted. Accident scenes get cleaned up. Vehicle damage gets repaired. The longer you wait, the harder it becomes to prove what happened.

### Witnesses Forget

People's memories fade quickly. A witness who saw everything clearly a week after the accident might not remember details a year later.

### Medical Records Get Harder to Obtain

Doctors retire. Clinics close. Medical records can be difficult to track down after time passes.

### Insurance Companies Get Suspicious

If you wait a long time to file a claim, insurance companies will argue you must not have been hurt that badly. Why else would you wait?

### You Need Money Now

Medical bills pile up. You might be missing work. Your family is struggling. The sooner you start the legal process, the sooner you can get compensation.

## The Discovery Rule: When the Clock Really Starts

In some cases, the statute of limitations doesn't start until you **discover** (or reasonably should have discovered) your injury.

**Example:** A doctor performs surgery and accidentally leaves a sponge inside you. You don't notice any problems until 18 months later when you start having pain. The discovery rule would start the 2-year clock when you discovered the sponge—not when the surgery happened.

However, the discovery rule is complicated and doesn't apply to all cases. Don't assume it applies to your situation.

## What Happens If You Miss the Deadline

If you file a lawsuit after the statute of limitations expires, the defendant will file a "motion to dismiss" and the court will grant it. Your case is over.

**There are virtually no exceptions.** Courts enforce the statute of limitations strictly.

The only silver lining: You might still be able to file an insurance claim (insurance claims have separate deadlines from lawsuits). But your leverage in negotiations is gone if the insurance company knows you can't sue.

## Protect Your Rights: Contact a Lawyer Now

The best way to protect yourself is to contact a personal injury lawyer as soon as possible after your injury. Here's what a lawyer will do:

1. **Identify all applicable deadlines** — Some claims have shorter deadlines than others
2. **Preserve evidence** — Send preservation letters to prevent evidence destruction
3. **Start building your case** — The earlier, the better
4. **Handle all the legal work** — So you can focus on recovery

Most personal injury lawyers offer free consultations and work on contingency (you don't pay unless you win). There's no risk in calling.

"How much is my case worth?" It's the first question most personal injury clients ask—and for good reason. You've been hurt, you're missing work, medical bills are piling up, and you need to know if pursuing a claim is worth your time.

The honest answer: It depends. But this guide will explain exactly what factors determine your case value and give you a realistic idea of what to expect.

## The Two Types of Damages

Personal injury compensation falls into two main categories:

### Economic Damages (The Easy Math)

These are your actual, calculable losses:

- **Medical expenses** — Past and future doctor visits, surgery, physical therapy, medication, medical equipment
- **Lost wages** — Income you've lost while recovering
- **Lost earning capacity** — If your injury prevents you from earning what you used to
- **Property damage** — Vehicle repair or replacement
- **Out-of-pocket costs** — Transportation to appointments, home modifications, etc.

Economic damages are relatively straightforward to calculate. You add up your bills and lost income.

### Non-Economic Damages (The Harder Math)

These are your intangible losses:

- **Pain and suffering** — Physical pain from your injuries
- **Mental anguish** — Emotional distress, anxiety, depression, PTSD
- **Loss of enjoyment** — Inability to do activities you enjoyed before
- **Loss of consortium** — Impact on your relationship with your spouse
- **Disfigurement** — Scarring or permanent physical changes

Non-economic damages are harder to quantify. How do you put a dollar value on pain? This is where experienced attorneys earn their fee—they know how to document and argue for maximum non-economic damages.

## Factors That Increase Case Value

### 1. Severity of Injuries

The more serious your injuries, the more your case is worth. A broken leg that heals completely is worth less than a spinal cord injury that leaves you paralyzed.

**High-value injuries include:**
- Traumatic brain injuries (TBI)
- Spinal cord injuries
- Amputations
- Severe burns
- Permanent disabilities
- Injuries requiring surgery

### 2. Clear Liability

If the other party is clearly at fault, your case is stronger. Disputed liability reduces case value because there's a risk you'll lose at trial.

**Clear liability examples:**
- Rear-end collisions (almost always the rear driver's fault)
- Drunk driving accidents
- Running red lights captured on camera
- Violations of safety regulations

### 3. Good Documentation

Cases with strong evidence are worth more. This includes:
- Medical records showing consistent treatment
- Photos of injuries and accident scene
- Police reports
- Witness statements
- Expert testimony

### 4. Impact on Daily Life

If your injury significantly affects your ability to work, care for yourself, or enjoy life, your case is worth more. A hand injury to a pianist is more valuable than the same injury to someone who works at a desk.

### 5. Insurance Coverage

Unfortunately, you can't get blood from a stone. If the at-fault party has minimal insurance and no assets, your recovery is limited—even if your injuries are severe.

**Types of coverage that matter:**
- Liability coverage (the other driver's policy)
- Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage (your own policy)
- Umbrella policies
- Commercial insurance (if a company is liable)

## Factors That Decrease Case Value

### 1. Pre-Existing Conditions

If you had a back problem before the accident, the insurance company will argue your current pain is from the old injury, not the new accident.

**But here's the good news:** Under Texas law, defendants take plaintiffs "as they find them." If you had a vulnerable back and the accident made it worse, you can still recover for the aggravation.

### 2. Gaps in Treatment

If you don't see a doctor for weeks after the accident, or skip appointments during recovery, insurance companies will argue you must not be that hurt.

**Tip:** Follow all medical advice. Go to every appointment. Don't give insurers ammunition.

### 3. Inconsistent Statements

If you told the police one thing and your doctor another, the insurance company will use those inconsistencies against you. Always be honest and consistent.

### 4. Social Media Posts

That photo of you smiling at your kid's birthday party? The insurance company will use it to argue you're not really in pain. Be extremely careful about what you post online.

### 5. Your Own Fault

Texas follows "modified comparative fault." If you're partly at fault for the accident, your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault. If you're more than 50% at fault, you get nothing.

## Settlement Ranges (Rough Estimates)

Every case is unique, but here are rough ranges based on injury severity:

**Minor injuries (soft tissue, no surgery):**
$5,000 - $25,000

**Moderate injuries (broken bones, minor surgery):**
$25,000 - $100,000

**Serious injuries (major surgery, long recovery):**
$100,000 - $500,000

**Severe injuries (TBI, paralysis, amputation):**
$500,000 - $5,000,000+

**Wrongful death:**
$500,000 - $10,000,000+

Remember: These are rough estimates. Your case could be worth more or less depending on the specific facts.

## How Insurance Companies Calculate Offers

Insurance adjusters use various methods to calculate settlement offers:

### The Multiplier Method

Some adjusters multiply your medical expenses by a number (usually 1.5 to 5) based on injury severity, then add lost wages.

**Example:** $20,000 in medical bills × 3 = $60,000 + $10,000 lost wages = $70,000 offer

### Computer Programs

Many insurers use software like Colossus to generate settlement values based on injury codes and other factors. These programs often undervalue claims.

### Just Lowballing

Let's be honest: Insurance companies often just offer whatever they think you'll accept. They know unrepresented plaintiffs often take the first offer—even if it's far below fair value.

## Why You Need a Lawyer to Maximize Value

Insurance companies have teams of adjusters, investigators, and lawyers whose job is to minimize what they pay you. You need someone on your side who:

- Knows what your case is really worth
- Can document and prove your damages
- Understands how to negotiate effectively
- Is willing to go to trial if necessary

Studies consistently show that plaintiffs with attorneys receive significantly higher settlements than those without—even after attorney fees.

What if you were partly at fault for your accident? Maybe you were speeding a little. Maybe you weren't paying full attention. Maybe you made a mistake.

Here's the good news: In Texas, you can still recover damages even if you share some blame—as long as you're not more than 50% at fault.

Here's the catch: Your compensation will be reduced by your percentage of fault.

This is called "comparative fault," and understanding how it works is crucial to your personal injury case.

## Texas Modified Comparative Fault: The 51% Rule

Texas follows a "modified comparative fault" system with a 51% bar. Here's how it works:

**You can recover damages if you're 50% or less at fault.**

**You cannot recover anything if you're 51% or more at fault.**

And your recovery is reduced by your percentage of fault.

### Example 1: You're 20% at Fault

You're in a car accident. The other driver ran a red light, but you were going 10 mph over the speed limit. The jury finds you 20% at fault.

Your damages: $100,000
Your fault: 20%
Your recovery: $100,000 - 20% = $80,000

### Example 2: You're 50% at Fault

A pedestrian is hit while jaywalking, but the driver was also texting. The jury finds the pedestrian 50% at fault.

Damages: $200,000
Fault: 50%
Recovery: $200,000 - 50% = $100,000

The pedestrian still recovers $100,000.

### Example 3: You're 51% at Fault

Same scenario, but the jury finds the pedestrian 51% at fault.

Damages: $200,000
Fault: 51%
Recovery: $0

One percentage point makes the difference between $100,000 and nothing.

## How Fault Is Determined

Fault in Texas is determined by a jury (or judge in a bench trial) based on the evidence. They consider:

### Traffic Laws

Who violated traffic laws? Running red lights, speeding, failure to yield, and other violations are strong evidence of fault.

### Witness Testimony

What did witnesses see? Their accounts help establish what each party did.

### Physical Evidence

Skid marks, vehicle damage patterns, and accident reconstruction can show what happened.

### Police Reports

While not conclusive, police reports often include the officer's opinion about fault.

### Expert Testimony

Accident reconstructionists, engineers, and other experts may testify about how the accident happened.

## Common Fault Scenarios

### Rear-End Collisions

The rear driver is almost always found at fault—they should have maintained a safe following distance. But if the front driver suddenly cut you off, they might share blame.

### Intersection Accidents

Who had the right of way? Did anyone run a light? Were both drivers distracted? Intersection accidents often involve shared fault.

### Pedestrian Accidents

Pedestrians aren't automatically blameless. Jaywalking, darting into traffic, or crossing against signals can assign fault to the pedestrian.

### Motorcycle Accidents

Motorcyclists are often blamed unfairly. Lane splitting isn't allowed in Texas, but simply riding a motorcycle isn't evidence of fault.

### Multi-Vehicle Accidents

With three or more vehicles, fault can be split multiple ways. Each party's fault is calculated separately.

## How Insurance Companies Use Comparative Fault Against You

Insurance companies love comparative fault because it gives them leverage to reduce settlements. Here's how they use it:

### Inflating Your Fault

Adjusters will look for any reason to assign you more blame. Were you on your phone? Did you admit to speeding? Did you fail to wear a seatbelt?

They'll push your fault percentage as high as possible to reduce what they owe.

### "Failure to Mitigate" Claims

Did you delay medical treatment? Skip physical therapy? Insurers argue you're partly at fault for making your injuries worse.

### Pre-Existing Conditions

If you had a prior injury, insurers claim the accident didn't cause your current problems—shifting blame to you.

### Social Media "Evidence"

That photo of you hiking two weeks after the accident? They'll use it to argue you're not really hurt—and therefore partly at fault for exaggerating claims.

## How to Protect Yourself

### Don't Admit Fault

Never say "I'm sorry" or admit any blame at the accident scene, to police, or to insurance companies. Let the investigation determine fault.

### Get Everything in Writing

Document everything. Photos, witness contact info, police reports. The more evidence you have, the harder it is for insurers to inflate your fault.

### Hire an Experienced Lawyer

An experienced attorney knows how to:
- Counter insurance company tactics
- Present evidence that minimizes your fault
- Argue effectively to juries about comparative fault
- Negotiate settlements that account for disputed fault

### Don't Give Recorded Statements

Insurance adjusters will ask for recorded statements to get you on record saying things they can use against you. Politely decline until you've talked to a lawyer.

## The Importance of the 51% Threshold

Because of Texas's 51% bar, fault disputes are often battles over single percentage points. The difference between 50% and 51% is the difference between some compensation and nothing.

This is why having an experienced attorney matters. They know how to:
- Present evidence that maximizes the other party's fault
- Counter arguments that inflate your fault
- Negotiate from a position of strength
- Go to trial if the insurance company won't budge
