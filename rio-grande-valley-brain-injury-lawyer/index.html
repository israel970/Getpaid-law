            <h2>Why You Need a Rio Grande Valley Brain Injury Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are among the most devastating and life-altering injuries a person can suffer. Even 'mild' concussions can cause persistent symptoms, while severe TBIs can result in permanent cognitive impairment, personality changes, and the need for lifetime care. Our Rio Grande Valley brain injury attorneys understand the full scope of TBI impacts and fight for compensation that reflects the true cost of these injuries.</p>
            <p>Brain injuries require specialized medical care, extensive rehabilitation, and often ongoing support for activities of daily living. Calculating fair compensation requires medical experts, life care planners, and economists who can project future needs. We work with leading experts to build cases that demonstrate the full impact of brain injuries on our clients' lives.</p>
            <p>In Rio Grande Valley, brain injuries result from car accidents, truck collisions, motorcycle crashes, falls, workplace incidents, assaults, and other traumatic events. Regardless of how your injury occurred, if someone else's negligence caused it, you deserve full compensation for your past, present, and future damages.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What are symptoms of traumatic brain injury?</h3>
                    <p>TBI symptoms include headaches, dizziness, nausea, memory problems, difficulty concentrating, mood changes, sleep disturbances, sensitivity to light and sound, and personality changes. Symptoms may appear immediately or develop over days or weeks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much compensation can I receive for a brain injury?</h3>
                    <p>Brain injury settlements vary widely based on severity. Mild TBIs may settle for tens of thousands, while severe TBIs requiring lifetime care often result in multi-million dollar awards covering future medical care, lost earnings, and quality of life impacts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What medical evidence is needed for a brain injury case?</h3>
                    <p>Medical records, imaging studies (CT, MRI), neuropsychological testing, and expert medical opinions document brain injuries. We work with neurologists, neuropsychologists, and other specialists to fully document your injury.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is a life care plan?</h3>
                    <p>A life care plan is a detailed projection of all future medical care, therapy, assistance, and equipment a brain injury victim will need. Prepared by certified life care planners, these documents can show lifetime care costs in the millions of dollars.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where can I get brain injury treatment in Rio Grande Valley?</h3>
                    <p>For acute brain injuries, trauma centers provide emergency care—Valley Baptist Medical Center - Harlingen has neurology and neurosurgery capabilities.

                    <h3>How long does it take to recover from a brain injury?</h3>
                    <p>Recovery varies dramatically. Some concussion symptoms resolve in weeks, while severe TBIs may cause permanent impairment. Maximum medical improvement may take 2-3 years, but some recovery continues beyond that. Your legal case should account for long-term prognosis.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I sue for a concussion?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. While often called 'mild' TBI, concussions can cause significant symptoms and impact quality of life. If someone's negligence caused your concussion, you deserve compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, pain, and any lasting effects.</p>
