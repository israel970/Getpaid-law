            <h2>Why You Need a Kyle Brain Injury Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are among the most devastating and life-altering injuries a person can suffer. Even 'mild' concussions can cause persistent symptoms, while severe TBIs can result in permanent cognitive impairment, personality changes, and the need for lifetime care. Our Kyle brain injury attorneys understand the full scope of TBI impacts and fight for compensation that reflects the true cost of these injuries.</p>
            <p>Brain injuries require specialized medical care, extensive rehabilitation, and often ongoing support for activities of daily living. Calculating fair compensation requires medical experts, life care planners, and economists who can project future needs. We work with leading experts to build cases that demonstrate the full impact of brain injuries on our clients' lives.</p>
            <p>In Kyle, brain injuries result from car accidents, truck collisions, motorcycle crashes, falls, workplace incidents, assaults, and other traumatic events. Regardless of how your injury occurred, if someone else's negligence caused it, you deserve full compensation for your past, present, and future damages.</p>

                    <p>Recovery varies dramatically. Some concussion symptoms resolve in weeks, while severe TBIs may cause permanent impairment. Maximum medical improvement may take 2-3 years, but some recovery continues beyond that. Your legal case should account for long-term prognosis.</p>

                    <h3>Can I sue for a concussion?</h3>
