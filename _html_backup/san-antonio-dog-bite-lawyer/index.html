            <h2>Why You Need a San Antonio Dog Bite Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Dog attacks can cause devastating injuries—deep puncture wounds, severe lacerations, nerve damage, broken bones, and serious infections. Children are particularly vulnerable to facial injuries and psychological trauma. When negligent dog owners fail to control dangerous animals, our San Antonio dog bite attorneys help victims recover full compensation for their injuries.</p>
            <p>Texas uses a 'one bite rule' modified by negligence principles, meaning liability can exist even for first-time attacks if the owner was negligent in controlling their dog. We investigate each case to identify evidence of owner knowledge of dangerous propensities, inadequate confinement, and violations of local animal control ordinances.</p>
            <p>In San Antonio, dog attacks occur in neighborhoods, parks, on sidewalks, and even on private property. Certain breeds may pose higher risks, but any dog can cause serious injury. Our attorneys focus on owner negligence and failure to prevent foreseeable attacks, regardless of breed.</p>

            <p>Understanding Texas law is crucial for maximizing your recovery. Here are key legal principles affecting dog bite cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One Bite Rule:</strong> Texas traditionally required proof the dog had previously bitten or shown viciousness. However, owners can be liable under negligence even for first attacks if they failed to use reasonable care.</li>
                <li><strong>Negligence Per Se:</strong> Violations of leash laws or other animal control ordinances can establish negligence per se, making liability easier to prove.</li>
                <li><strong>Dangerous Dog Act:</strong> Texas has a Dangerous Dog Act requiring registration and confinement of dogs declared dangerous by authorities. Violations strengthen injury claims.</li>
                <li><strong>Homeowner's Insurance:</strong> Most dog bite claims are paid by homeowner's or renter's insurance, which typically covers liability for pet attacks up to policy limits.</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About San Antonio Dog Bites</h2>
            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What should I do after a dog attack?</h3>
                    <p>Seek immediate medical attention—dog bites easily become infected. Report the attack to local animal control. Get the owner's name, address, and insurance information. Photograph your injuries. Document the dog's breed and any prior aggressive behavior you know about.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I prove liability in a dog bite case?</h3>
                    <p>We investigate whether the owner knew the dog was dangerous, whether they violated leash laws or confinement requirements, and whether they took reasonable precautions. Witness statements, animal control records, and prior incident reports help establish liability.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What compensation can I receive for a dog bite?</h3>
                    <p>Compensation includes medical expenses (often extensive due to infection risk and scarring), plastic surgery costs, lost wages, pain and suffering, psychological trauma, and sometimes punitive damages if the owner knew the dog was dangerous.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does the dog owner's insurance cover attacks?</h3>
                    <p>Usually yes. Homeowner's and renter's insurance typically cover dog bite liability up to policy limits. Some policies exclude certain breeds, but the owner may still be personally liable.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where do dog attacks commonly occur in San Antonio?</h3>
                    <p>Dog attacks in San Antonio occur throughout residential neighborhoods, at parks, on sidewalks, and at the homes of dog owners. Children are often attacked while playing in yards or walking to school.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where should I go for treatment after a dog bite in San Antonio?</h3>
                    <p>Seek immediate medical attention—emergency rooms can handle serious bites. University Hospital treats dog attack injuries. Dog bites require thorough cleaning, antibiotics, and tetanus updates. Watch for signs of infection in following days.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if the dog had never bitten anyone before?</h3>
                    <p>Texas's 'one bite rule' isn't absolute. If the owner was negligent—failing to leash the dog, ignoring aggressive behavior, or violating local ordinances—liability can exist even for first-time attacks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I sue if the dog owner is a friend or family member?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Their homeowner's insurance typically pays claims, not them personally. Many dog bite claims involve known dogs because people interact closely with friends' and relatives' pets.</p>
