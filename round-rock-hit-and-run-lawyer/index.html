            <h2>Why You Need a Round Rock Hit and Run Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Being the victim of a hit and run accident in Round Rock adds insult to injury—literally. Not only are you dealing with physical injuries and property damage, but the person responsible fled the scene rather than taking responsibility. Our Round Rock hit and run attorneys work to identify the driver, and when they can't be found, we maximize your recovery through other sources.</p>
            <p>Texas law requires all drivers involved in accidents to stop and exchange information. Fleeing the scene is a crime—a felony if someone was injured or killed. But the criminal penalties the driver faces don't put money in your pocket. Our civil attorneys focus on getting you compensated, whether through finding the driver, pursuing other liable parties, or maximizing your uninsured motorist claim.</p>
            <p>Hit and run accidents in Round Rock often occur on busy roads like Interstate 35, State Highway 45 Toll, US Highway 79 and FM 1431 (University Boulevard), where drivers believe they can blend into traffic and escape. Our attorneys work with investigators, review surveillance footage, and pursue every lead to identify hit and run drivers and hold them accountable.</p>

            <p>A Round Rock hit and run attorney knows local resources—which businesses have surveillance cameras, how to work with Round Rock police investigators, and which private investigators specialize in finding hit and run drivers. We've handled numerous hit and run cases in Williamson County and know how to maximize recovery even when the driver is never found.</p>
            <p>Time is critical in hit and run cases. Surveillance footage is overwritten, witnesses forget details, and evidence disappears. We immediately begin investigation to preserve your ability to identify the driver and recover compensation.</p>

                <li><strong>Hit and Run Penalties:</strong> Failing to stop after an accident is a Class C misdemeanor if only property damage occurs, but becomes a felony if someone is injured (up to 5 years) or killed (up to 10 years).</li>
                <li><strong>Duty to Stop:</strong> Texas law requires all drivers involved in accidents to immediately stop, render aid if needed, and exchange information including name, address, and insurance.</li>
                <li><strong>UM/UIM Coverage:</strong> Texas insurers must offer uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, which provides compensation when hit and run drivers can't be found or lack adequate insurance.</li>
                <li><strong>Statute of Limitations:</strong> You have two years to file a lawsuit, but investigation to identify hit and run drivers should begin immediately.</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Round Rock Hit and Runs</h2>
            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What should I do right after a hit and run?</h3>
                    <p>Call 911 immediately. Note any details you remember about the vehicle—make, model, color, license plate, direction of travel. Look for witnesses. Check nearby businesses for surveillance cameras. Document your injuries and damage. Contact an attorney before calling insurance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I get compensation if the hit and run driver is never found?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Your own uninsured motorist (UM) coverage provides compensation when at-fault drivers can't be identified. We also investigate whether other parties may share liability, such as employers of commercial drivers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do attorneys find hit and run drivers?</h3>
                    <p>We canvas the area for surveillance footage, interview witnesses, work with police investigators, hire private investigators, search social media, and review local body shop records for vehicles matching your description.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I only got a partial license plate?</h3>
                    <p>Partial plate information combined with vehicle description can narrow down possibilities. Police and private investigators can search DMV records for matching vehicles in the area.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where do most hit and run accidents happen in Round Rock?</h3>
                    <p>Hit and run accidents in Round Rock commonly occur on busy roads like Interstate 35, State Highway 45 Toll, US Highway 79 and FM 1431 (University Boulevard) where drivers believe they can escape unnoticed. Parking lot hit and runs are also common.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Which hospitals treat hit and run accident victims in Round Rock?</h3>
                    <p>Seek immediate medical attention regardless of severity—hit and run victims often have adrenaline masking serious injuries. For serious injuries, Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Round Rock provides trauma care in the Round Rock area.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long do hit and run cases take?</h3>
                    <p>If the driver is quickly identified, cases proceed like typical accident claims (6-18 months). Uninsured motorist claims against your own insurance may resolve faster. Cases where extensive investigation is needed take longer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does my insurance go up if I file a hit and run claim?</h3>
                    <p>Filing a UM/UIM claim for a hit and run generally shouldn't increase your rates since you weren't at fault. However, insurance practices vary. This is another reason to consult an attorney before filing.</p>
