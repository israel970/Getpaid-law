            <h2>Why You Need a Dallas Motorcycle Accident Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Motorcycle accidents in Dallas often result in severe injuries because riders have no protection from the impact forces that vehicle occupants take for granted. When cars and trucks fail to see motorcycles or violate their right of way, the consequences can be catastrophic. Our Dallas motorcycle accident lawyers understand both the unique challenges riders face and how to overcome bias to win fair compensation.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, motorcycle riders often face prejudice from insurance adjusters, juries, and even law enforcement. There's a false assumption that motorcyclists are reckless thrill-seekers who cause their own accidents. Our attorneys combat this bias with evidence, expert testimony, and compelling presentation of the facts that show who was truly at fault.</p>
            <p>In Dallas, motorcycle accidents frequently occur on Interstate 35E, Interstate 30 (R.L. Thornton Freeway), Interstate 635 (LBJ Freeway) and US Highway 75 (Central Expressway), where car and truck drivers fail to look for motorcycles before changing lanes, turning left, or pulling out of driveways. Road hazards like potholes, debris, and oil slicks that cars barely notice can be deadly for motorcyclists.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Helmet Law:</strong> Texas requires helmets for riders under 21 and those without specific insurance or safety course completion. However, not wearing a helmet doesn't bar recovery or prove fault.</li>
                <li><strong>Lane Splitting:</strong> Texas does not currently allow lane splitting (riding between lanes of traffic). However, bills to allow it have been introduced.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparative Fault:</strong> Texas applies modified comparative fault to motorcycle cases. Riders can recover if less than 51% at fault, with damages reduced by their fault percentage.</li>
                <li><strong>Motorcycle Equipment:</strong> Texas law requires specific equipment including mirrors, turn signals, and lighting. Equipment violations don't automatically establish rider fault in crashes.</li>

            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will I be blamed for my motorcycle accident just because I was riding?</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately, bias against motorcyclists exists. Our attorneys counter this by presenting clear evidence of the other driver's negligence, using expert witnesses, and educating jurors about motorcycle safety and right-of-way laws.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What compensation can I receive for a motorcycle accident?</h3>
                    <p>Motorcycle accident victims can recover medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, property damage, and sometimes punitive damages. Because injuries tend to be severe, settlements are often significant.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does not wearing a helmet affect my case in Texas?</h3>
                    <p>Texas doesn't require helmets for all riders, and not wearing one doesn't make you automatically at fault. However, the defense may argue your head injuries would have been less severe with a helmet, potentially reducing damages.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What are the most dangerous roads for motorcycles in Dallas?</h3>
                    <p>In Dallas, motorcycle accident accidents frequently occur on Interstate 35E (particularly near I-35E at I-30 interchange), Interstate 30 (R.L. Thornton Freeway) (particularly near I-30 at I-35E), Interstate 635 (LBJ Freeway) (particularly near I-635 at US-75). These roads see heavy traffic and multiple factors contribute to their high accident rates.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where should I go for medical treatment after a motorcycle crash in Dallas?</h3>
                    <p>For serious injuries, get to the nearest trauma center immediately. Parkland Memorial Hospital provides trauma care for the severe injuries common in motorcycle crashes. For less serious injuries, urgent care can document everything for your case.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long do motorcycle accident cases take to settle?</h3>
                    <p>Motorcycle cases often take longer than car accident cases because injuries are more severe and require longer treatment. Most cases settle within 6-18 months, though complex cases requiring litigation take longer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I sue if road conditions caused my motorcycle crash?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, in some cases. If potholes, debris, or inadequate maintenance contributed to your crash, the government entity responsible for the road may be liable. These cases have special requirements and shorter deadlines.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What should I tell the insurance company after a motorcycle accident?</h3>
                    <p>As little as possible. Insurance adjusters look for ways to blame motorcyclists. Don't give recorded statements, don't speculate about fault, and don't sign anything without consulting an attorney first.</p>
