            <h2>Why You Need a Austin Uber/Lyft Accident Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Rideshare accidents in Austin present unique legal challenges because multiple insurance policies may apply depending on the driver's status at the time of the crash. Whether you were a passenger, another driver, or a pedestrian injured by an Uber or Lyft driver, determining which insurance applies—and maximizing your recovery—requires specialized knowledge that our attorneys provide.</p>
            <p>Both Uber and Lyft provide up to $1 million in liability coverage when drivers are actively transporting passengers. However, coverage is reduced when drivers are waiting for ride requests, and personal insurance typically denies rideshare-related claims. Navigating this maze of coverage requires an experienced rideshare accident attorney.</p>
            <p>In Austin, Uber and Lyft drivers operate throughout the metropolitan area, with heavy concentrations near downtown, the airport, and entertainment districts, the airport, entertainment districts, and hotels. Our attorneys handle rideshare accidents across Austin and understand the local factors that contribute to these crashes.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>TNC Insurance Requirements:</strong> Texas requires Transportation Network Companies like Uber/Lyft to maintain specific insurance coverage at different driver status levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Period 1 Coverage:</strong> When the driver is logged into the app but hasn't accepted a ride: $50,000/$100,000/$25,000 minimum coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Period 2 & 3 Coverage:</strong> Once a ride is accepted through trip completion: $1 million liability coverage plus uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Insurance Gap:</strong> Most personal auto policies exclude rideshare driving. Drivers without rideshare endorsements may have coverage gaps.</li>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much insurance covers Uber/Lyft accidents?</h3>
                    <p>Coverage depends on driver status. During active trips, up to $1 million in liability coverage applies. When logged in but waiting for rides, minimum coverage is $50,000/$100,000/$25,000. When offline, only the driver's personal insurance applies.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I sue Uber or Lyft directly?</h3>
                    <p>Generally no—drivers are classified as independent contractors, not employees. However, you can pursue claims against the rideshare companies' insurance policies, which provide substantial coverage during active rides.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>I was an Uber passenger injured in a crash. What are my options?</h3>
                    <p>As a passenger, you're covered by Uber's $1 million insurance policy regardless of who caused the accident. You can also pursue claims against any at-fault drivers' insurance. Our attorneys ensure you maximize recovery from all available sources.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if the Uber driver was at fault for my accident?</h3>
                    <p>If the Uber driver caused the accident while on an active trip, the $1 million liability policy covers your injuries. If they were between rides or offline, coverage determination becomes more complex.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where do most rideshare accidents occur in Austin?</h3>
                    <p>Rideshare accidents in Austin commonly occur in entertainment districts, near the airport, around downtown hotels, and in busy commercial areas where drivers are frequently picking up and dropping off passengers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Which hospitals should I go to after a rideshare accident in Austin?</h3>
                    <p>For serious injuries, seek trauma center care immediately. Dell Seton Medical Center at The University of Texas provides emergency services for accident victims. Document all medical treatment carefully—rideshare insurance claims require thorough documentation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long do Uber/Lyft accident claims take to resolve?</h3>
                    <p>Rideshare claims can take 6-18 months due to coverage disputes and the complexity of determining which insurance applies. Having an experienced attorney often speeds the process by cutting through insurance company delays.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>The rideshare driver was uninsured. Do I have options?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Uber and Lyft provide uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage during active trips. If you were injured by an uninsured rideshare driver during a trip, this coverage protects you.</p>
