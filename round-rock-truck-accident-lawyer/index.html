            <h2>Why You Need a Round Rock Truck Accident Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Commercial truck accidents in Round Rock often result in catastrophic injuries or death. With fully loaded trucks weighing up to 80,000 pounds, the physics of a collision between a big rig and a passenger vehicle are devastating. If you or a loved one has been injured in a truck crash, you need a Round Rock truck accident lawyer who understands federal trucking regulations and can take on powerful trucking companies.</p>
            <p>Truck accident cases are fundamentally different from car accident cases. Multiple parties may share liability, including the driver, trucking company, cargo loader, and maintenance provider. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations create additional standards of care. Evidence like electronic logging device (ELD) data must be preserved quickly before it's destroyed.</p>
            <p>In Round Rock, truck accidents frequently occur on Interstate 35, State Highway 45 Toll, US Highway 79 and FM 1431 (University Boulevard), where commercial traffic mixes with commuters. These crashes often involve hours-of-service violations, inadequate training, improper cargo loading, or deferred maintenance. Our team knows how to investigate trucking company records and hold all responsible parties accountable.</p>

            <h2>Why Choose a Local Round Rock Attorney?</h2>
            <p>Truck accidents in Round Rock require attorneys who know both local roads and federal trucking law.

Our relationships with accident reconstruction experts and trucking industry consultants give us an edge in building winning cases.</p>
            <p>Time is especially critical in truck accident cases. Trucking companies send rapid response teams to accident scenes to begin building their defense.

            <div class="faq-container">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Who is liable in a Round Rock truck accident?</h3>
                    <p>Multiple parties may share liability: the truck driver, trucking company, cargo loading company, maintenance provider, truck or parts manufacturer, and even the shipper if cargo was improperly described. An experienced attorney investigates all potentially responsible parties.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How are truck accident cases different from car accidents?</h3>
                    <p>Truck cases involve federal regulations, multiple defendants, larger insurance policies ($750,000-$1 million minimum), and more severe injuries. They require specialized investigation including ELD data analysis, driver qualification file review, and maintenance record examination.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What compensation can I receive for a truck accident injury?</h3>
                    <p>Truck accident settlements are typically larger than car accident cases due to severe injuries and higher insurance limits. Compensation includes medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and potentially punitive damages. Many cases settle for six or seven figures.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long do I have to file a truck accident lawsuit in Texas?</h3>
                    <p>The statute of limitations is two years from the accident date. However, preserving evidence requires immediate action—ELD data and maintenance records can be legally destroyed after six months if not preserved.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where do most truck accidents happen in Round Rock?</h3>
                    <p>In Round Rock, truck accident accidents frequently occur on Interstate 35 (particularly near I-35 at SH-45 Toll), State Highway 45 Toll (particularly near SH-45 at I-35), US Highway 79 (particularly near US-79 at I-35). These roads see heavy traffic and multiple factors contribute to their high accident rates.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What medical facilities treat truck accident victims in Round Rock?</h3>
                    <p>Due to the severity of truck accident injuries, victims often need Level I or Level II trauma centers. In the Round Rock area, Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Round Rock provides trauma care for serious injuries including traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, and internal injuries.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I talk to the trucking company's insurance adjuster?</h3>
                    <p>No. Trucking company insurers are experienced at getting victims to make statements that hurt their cases. They may record calls, ask leading questions, and use your words against you. Let an attorney handle all insurance communication.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is a spoliation letter and why is it important?</h3>
                    <p>A spoliation letter legally requires the trucking company to preserve all evidence including ELD data, driver logs, maintenance records, dash cam footage, and dispatch communications. Without this letter, companies may legally destroy evidence that could prove your case.</p>
