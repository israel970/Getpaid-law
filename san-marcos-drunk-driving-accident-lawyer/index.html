            <h2>Why You Need a San Marcos Drunk Driving Accident Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Drunk driving accidents in San Marcos cause preventable tragedies every day. When an impaired driver chooses to get behind the wheel and injures innocent people, victims deserve more than just compensation for their injuries—they deserve justice. Our San Marcos drunk driving accident attorneys pursue all available damages, including punitive damages that punish reckless behavior.</p>
            <p>Texas takes drunk driving seriously, with criminal penalties for DUI/DWI. But the criminal case is separate from your civil claim for damages. Even if the drunk driver isn't convicted—or only faces minor criminal penalties—you can still pursue substantial civil compensation for your injuries, lost wages, pain and suffering, and more.</p>
            <p>In San Marcos, drunk driving accidents peak on weekend nights and near entertainment districts. But impaired driving occurs at all hours on highways like Interstate 35, State Highway 80, Ranch Road 12 and Wonder World Drive. If you've been injured by a drunk driver, our attorneys can help you navigate both the legal process and the emotional trauma of being victimized by someone's reckless choice.</p>

            <p>Understanding Texas law is crucial for maximizing your recovery. Here are key legal principles affecting drunk driving accident cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Per Se Intoxication:</strong> Texas considers drivers legally intoxicated at .08 BAC or higher. Higher BAC levels (.15+) result in enhanced criminal penalties and stronger civil cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Dram Shop Act:</strong> Texas allows claims against alcohol providers who serve obviously intoxicated adults or any alcohol to minors who then cause accidents.</li>
                <li><strong>Punitive Damages:</strong> Drunk driving typically meets the 'gross negligence' standard for punitive damages, which are capped at the greater of $200,000 or twice economic damages plus equal non-economic damages.</li>
                <li><strong>Criminal vs. Civil:</strong> Criminal conviction isn't required for civil recovery. Different standards of proof apply—civil cases require preponderance of evidence, not beyond reasonable doubt.</li>

                    <h3>What is a dram shop claim?</h3>
                    <p>Texas's Dram Shop Act allows claims against bars, restaurants, and stores that serve alcohol to obviously intoxicated persons or minors who then cause accidents. This adds another source of recovery beyond the drunk driver's insurance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does the criminal case affect my civil claim?</h3>
                    <p>The cases are separate but related. Criminal conviction isn't required for civil recovery, but conviction can help establish liability. Police reports, BAC test results, and other criminal evidence can be used in your civil case.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if the drunk driver doesn't have insurance?</h3>
                    <p>You may have claims against bars that over-served them (dram shop), your own uninsured motorist coverage, or other liable parties. Our attorneys investigate all potential sources of recovery.</p>

                    <h3>Where do most drunk driving accidents occur in San Marcos?</h3>
                    <p>Drunk driving accidents in San Marcos are concentrated near entertainment districts, bars, and restaurants, particularly on weekend nights. However, impaired driving occurs throughout the area on highways like Interstate 35, State Highway 80, Ranch Road 12 and Wonder World Drive.</p>

                    <h3>Which hospitals treat drunk driving accident victims in San Marcos?</h3>
                    <p>Drunk driving accidents often cause severe injuries requiring trauma care. CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Hospital - San Marcos provides emergency and trauma services for serious accident injuries in the San Marcos area.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long do drunk driving accident cases take?</h3>
                    <p>These cases often take 12-24 months because they may involve waiting for criminal case resolution, investigating dram shop claims, and building strong punitive damages arguments. Complex cases with multiple defendants take longer.</p>

                    <h3>Can I sue the bar that served the drunk driver?</h3>
                    <p>Potentially yes, under Texas's Dram Shop Act. If the bar served someone who was obviously intoxicated, or served any alcohol to a minor, and that person then caused your accident, the bar may share liability.</p>
