            <h2>Why You Need a Round Rock Work Injury Lawyer</h2>
            <p class="lead">Workplace injuries in Round Rock can change your life in an instant. Whether you work in construction, oil and gas, manufacturing, healthcare, or any other industry, you deserve full compensation when employer negligence, third-party actions, or unsafe conditions cause your injury. Our Round Rock work injury attorneys help injured workers explore all options beyond limited workers' compensation benefits.</p>
            <p>Texas is unique—it's the only state that doesn't require most private employers to carry workers' compensation insurance. If your employer is a 'non-subscriber,' you may be able to sue them directly for your full damages. Even if your employer does have workers' comp, you may have third-party claims against equipment manufacturers, property owners, or other contractors.</p>
            <p>In Round Rock, work injuries occur across all industries, from construction sites and oil fields to offices and retail stores. Common injuries include falls, equipment accidents, repetitive stress injuries, toxic exposures, and vehicle accidents while working. Our attorneys evaluate each case to identify all potential sources of recovery.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-Subscriber Liability:</strong> Texas employers who don't carry workers' comp (non-subscribers) can be sued directly. They can't use contributory negligence, assumed risk, or co-employee negligence as defenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Workers' Comp Limits:</strong> Texas workers' comp provides limited wage replacement (70% of average weekly wage up to state maximum) and medical benefits, but no pain and suffering compensation.</li>
                <li><strong>Third Party Claims:</strong> Even with workers' comp, you can sue third parties like equipment manufacturers, property owners, or other contractors whose negligence contributed to your injury.</li>
                <li><strong>OSHA Violations:</strong> Employer violations of OSHA safety regulations can help establish negligence in injury claims.</li>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I sue my employer for a work injury in Texas?</h3>
                    <p>It depends on whether your employer carries workers' compensation insurance. If they're a 'non-subscriber' without workers' comp, you can sue them directly for full damages. If they have workers' comp, benefits are generally your exclusive remedy against them (but you may have third-party claims).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between workers' comp and a personal injury lawsuit?</h3>
                    <p>Workers' comp provides guaranteed but limited benefits—medical care and partial wage replacement. Personal injury lawsuits can recover full lost wages, pain and suffering, and other damages, but require proving someone's negligence caused your injury.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What third-party claims might I have for a work injury?</h3>
                    <p>Potential third-party defendants include equipment manufacturers (defective products), property owners (premises liability), other contractors (negligent actions), and vehicle drivers (if injured in work-related crash). We investigate all possibilities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What should I do after getting hurt at work?</h3>
                    <p>Report the injury to your supervisor immediately. Seek medical attention. Document everything including photos and witness names. Don't sign anything without understanding your rights. Consult an attorney before accepting workers' comp settlements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Which industries have the most work injuries in Round Rock?</h3>
                    <p>In Round Rock, construction, oil and gas, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation see the most serious workplace injuries. However, injuries can occur in any workplace, and all deserve proper compensation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Where should I go for medical treatment after a work injury?</h3>
                    <p>For emergencies, go to the nearest emergency room—Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Round Rock treats workplace injuries. For workers' comp claims, you may need to see approved providers. For non-subscriber cases, you can choose your own doctors.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long do I have to file a work injury claim?</h3>
                    <p>Workers' comp claims should be reported within 30 days. Personal injury lawsuits against non-subscribers or third parties have a two-year statute of limitations. Acting quickly preserves your rights and evidence.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I be fired for filing a work injury claim?</h3>
                    <p>Texas law prohibits retaliation for filing workers' comp claims. If you're fired for claiming benefits, you may have an additional retaliation claim. Non-subscriber claims have different protections.</p>
